=== Write Functions

Each field and register is parameterized with a _write function_. By default,
the write function is `groov::w::replace`.

[source,cpp]
----
using my_field = groov::field<"field", std::uint32_t, 3, 0, groov::w::replace>;
----

==== Write functions

Built-in write functions are in the `groov::w` namespace. Examples are:

- `replace` ("normal write")
- `ignore`

There are 16 possible write functions, each characterized by a truth table
relating the current value *C*, the written value *W* and the result *R*. For
example:

.Truth table for replace
[width=30%,cols="1,1,1"]
|===
^h|C ^h|W ^h|R

^|0 ^|0 ^|0
^|0 ^|1 ^|1
^|1 ^|0 ^|0
^|1 ^|1 ^|1
|===

.Truth table for ignore
[width=30%,cols="1,1,1"]
|===
^h|C ^h|W ^h|R

^|0 ^|0 ^|0
^|0 ^|1 ^|0
^|1 ^|0 ^|1
^|1 ^|1 ^|1
|===

==== Identity specs

Each write function may have an identity spec indicated by its truth table and
exposed as the alias `id_spec`. For `replace`, the identity spec is `none`.
For `ignore`, the identity spec is `any`. There are 4 possible identity specs:

- `none`
- `zero`
- `one`
- `any`

Each identity spec (except `none`) has a function that computes the identity for
a field according to its bit range:

[source,cpp]
----
template <std::unsigned_integral T, std::size_t Msb, std::size_t Lsb>
constexpr static auto identity() -> T;
----

==== Building the write masks

In general a given write to a register will only want to write some of the field
values. The other field values are left unspecified. The write machinery uses
the field write functions and their associated identity specs to compute:

- the write mask for the fields to be written
- the identity mask for the other fields
- the identity value (if any) for the other fields

For example:

[source,cpp]
----
// the default write function is groov::w::replace
using my_field_0 = groov::field<"field_0", std::uint32_t, 9, 0>;
using my_field_1 = groov::field<"field_1", std::uint32_t, 31, 10>;
using my_reg = groov::reg<"reg", std::uint32_t, 0xa'0000, groov::w::replace,
                           my_field_0, my_field_1>;

// when writing only field_1:
write(grp("my_reg.field_1"_f = 42));

// results in a call to bus::write as if:
constexpr auto write_mask = 0xffff'fc00u; // mask for field_1
constexpr auto identity_mask = 0u;        // field_0 has id_spec none
constexpr auto identity_value = 0u;       // field_0 has id_spec none

// the write mask and the identity mask don't cover the range of the register,
// so the bus must read-modify-write to preserve unwritten bits
bus::template write<write_mask, identity_mask, identity_value>(/* ... */);
----

But if the unwritten field(s) are read-only (or otherwise have an identity):

[source,cpp]
----
using my_field_0 = groov::field<"field_0", std::uint32_t, 9, 0, groov::w::ignore>;
using my_field_1 = groov::field<"field_1", std::uint32_t, 31, 10>;
using my_reg = groov::reg<"reg", std::uint32_t, 0xa'0000, groov::w::replace,
                           my_field_0, my_field_1>;

// when writing only field_1:
write(grp("my_reg.field_1"_f = 42));

// results in a call to bus::write as if:
constexpr auto write_mask = 0xffff'fc00u;    // mask for field_1
constexpr auto identity_mask = 0x0000'03ffu; // field_0 has id_spec any
constexpr auto identity_value = 0u;          // field_0 has id_spec any (zeroes are arbitrary)

// the write mask and the identity mask cover the range of the register,
// so the bus may OR the identity value with the written value to preserve
// unwritten bits and avoid read-modify-write
bus::template write<write_mask, identity_mask, identity_value>(/* ... */);
----

==== Custom write functions

Custom write functions can be used to deal with registers that have special requirements.

NOTE: Try not to think of registers/fields as simply "read-only" or similar. While
"read-only" is a good interface-level abstraction, it's not the same concept when
dealing with hardware. Individual bits are not addressable, so a register whose
bits are not _all_ "read-only" must be written with _some value_ for those bits
(which the hardware may or may not ignore). This is the job of the write
function in concert with the bus.

Imagine that we have a register containing one "writable" bit, and other reserved
bits whose write semantics are specified:

[width=80%,cols="4,1,8"]
|===
^h|Field ^h|Bits ^h|Description

^|Reserved ^|7 ^|Reserved. Write as 0.
^|Reserved ^|6 ^|Reserved. Write as 1.
^|Reserved ^|5 ^|Reserved. Write as 1.
^|Reserved ^|4 ^|Reserved. Write as 0.
^|Reserved ^|3 ^|Reserved. Write as 0.
^|Reserved ^|2 ^|Reserved. Write as 0.
^|ENABLE   ^|1 ^|Enable bit.
^|Reserved ^|0 ^|Reserved. Write as 0.
|===

Note the write semantics here. Bits 5 and 6 must be written as `1`. The other
reserved bits must be written as `0`.

In order to model this, we could create 3 fields inside a single register -- with
an appropriate group and bus:
[source,cpp]
----
using F0 = groov::field<"reserved0", std::uint8_t, 0, 0, groov::w::ignore>;
using FE = groov::field<"enable", std::uint8_t, 1, 1>;
using F1 = groov::field<"reserved1", std::uint8_t, 7, 2, custom_write_func>;

using R =
    groov::reg<"reg", std::uint32_t, REG_ADDRESS, groov::w::replace, F0, FE, F1>;
using G = groov::group<"group1", bus_t, R>;
----

Notice that `R`â€‹'s write function is the default `w::replace` which is
overridden at the level of individual fields. We are going to write to this
register, after all.

In user code, we'll only write to the `enable` field (`FE`):
[source,cpp]
----
groov::write(G{}("reg.enable"_f = 1)) | async::sync_wait();
----

The table tells us to write bit 0 as 0, and this is already the default given by
`w::ignore`, so that's OK for `F0`.

The `custom_write_func` needs to provide the correct "identity value" to
write to `F1`. This it can do with an appropriate `id_spec`:
[source,cpp]
----
struct custom_write_func {
    struct id_spec {
        template <std::unsigned_integral T, std::size_t Msb, std::size_t Lsb>
        constexpr static auto identity() -> T {
            // sanity checks: this is just for F1
            static_assert(Msb == 7);
            static_assert(Lsb == 2);
            return 0b0110'0000u; // bits 5 and 6 are 1
        }
    };
};
----

And the bus's `write` function must take account of the identity mask and value
as well as the user-supplied bit(s) to write, for example:
[source,cpp]
----
template <auto Mask, auto IdMask, auto IdValue>
static auto write(auto addr, auto value) -> async::sender auto {
    return async::just_result_of([=] {
        auto prev = *addr & ~(Mask | IdMask);
        *addr = prev | value | IdValue;
    });
}
----

The result of this is that when we write to the `enable` field, the other bits
of the register get written correctly.
